# Predict-Burn-Out
* I am interested in predicting the values for burn rate using either or both of the independent variables (features) 
* Features: 
  

        Resource Allocation (RA): The amount of resource allocated to the employee to work, ie. number of working hours.
        On a scale of 1 to 10, strictly integers.
   
        Mental Fatigue Score (MS): The level of fatigue mentally the employee is facing.
        On a scale of 1 to 10, float datatype, where 0.0 means no fatigue and 10.0 means complete fatigue.





* Why does this matter ?

  

It helps employers prevent foreseeable burn out, boost overall productivity and efficiency, and consequently save money 
for their companies.

Specifically, burnout can lead to a range of costs for employers, including:

+ Decreased Productivity: Burn out could hinder creativity and innovation within an organization. 
+ Employee Turnover: Employees experiencing burnout may leave the organization, resulting in recruitment and training
  costs for new hires.
+ Impact on Company Culture: Burnout can have a negative impact on the overall company culture and employee morale.

* Target:
 
    
        Burn Rate (BR): The value we need to predict for each employee telling the rate of burn out while working.
        On a scale of 0 to 1, float datatype
